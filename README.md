Use `golang` to implement algorithms and data structures. And every implementation has unit test. This repo is for learning purpose.

Already implemented algorithms:
* Sort:
  * Insertion sort
  * Merge sort
  * Counting sort
  * Radix sort 


Already implemented data structures:
* Hash table
* Linked list
* Binary tree
